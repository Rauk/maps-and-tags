# maps-and-tags

So far the basic map has been loaded, first need to create level on top of map for search and tags

Basic search is there and the listings are being shown on the maps UI but we didn't get any explicit list so far. Need to have a temporary list over here(not sure about pagenation etc), there is also a certain icon being used to denote places, need to learn about that. Also selecting a certain place should return details about the place.:wq
